        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <h2>For 5 years, we have been consistent with our work of aiding to connect parents with children with autism to child care workers who are qualified to offer such services.</h2>
        <p>Our company is set to help mostly children with autism. Most of these children are having a hard time to get qualified treatment from qualified workers. Most of the parents always stay at home to take care of the kids but some need to also go to work to support their children. This company will help parents get qualified service providers for their children who are abled differently.</p>
